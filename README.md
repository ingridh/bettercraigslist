Landing Page:
For our landing page, we have the logo in the top left corner as well as the main features on a top bar. This lets the users find what they want really quickly and their eyes quickly locate them as they scan the page. 
We have the logo really big in the center to show the users where they are. If they do not know what is CraigsList, there is an "About Us" and "Help" option above. In addition, we have a tips tab that theoretically will pop up some hints if the user is stuck. Also the tips can be used to toggle perhaps popular searches if the user wants to browse around. Below the logo is a search bar where users can type in what they want to buy.

Main View:
This is the page that users will go if they do not know what they want specifically. Users can then narrow down their search using the user friendly icons on the page. On the left is a sidebar where users can re enter their search or find out more about us. Also there is a big sell something button for the sellers. The top bar and logo stay the same.

Side Bar and Item:
Simplified and cleaned up version of the actual craiglist site.
